# blood_Circulatory_system
Using graph theory

“The blood circulatory system (cardiovascular system) delivers nutrients and oxygen to all cells in the body.
 It consists of the heart and the blood vessels running through the entire body. The arteries carry blood away from the heart;
 the veins carry it back to the heart.”


Using the Graph Theory,program to simulate human blood circulatory system.

this program will demonstrate four chambers of heart, other vital organs in the body, flow rate, distances, directions, etc.

this will Represent Red blood cells, white blood cells, and Platelets using separate data structures.

They are able to traverse through above mentioned organs. 

Based on their lifespans, show some profiling information of different cell types.
 (e.g calculate the probability and number of times a red blood cells traverse each important organ in a human body.)
